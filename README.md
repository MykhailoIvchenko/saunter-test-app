Saunter App allows you create routes for walking and save them in DB.
You should enter route title, short and full description, and pin way point 
on the map. After creating and saving you can move any route to favourites 
or delete it from DB.
The list of routes displaying principle is next:
- favourite routes have high priority and they are placed at the top of list;
- favourite routes are listed starting from the last added from top to bottom;
- ordinary routes have low priority and they are listed starting from the 
  last added from top to bottom;
